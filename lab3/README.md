1) Along the west coast of BC, what are the most exposed areas to coastal hazards?

A1) In general, the southeasterly portions of our Vancouver Island study area are more exposed to coastal hazards.

2) Where is risk reduction provided by coastal habitats greatest?

A2) In general, coastal habitats reduce coastal exposure risk. The risk reduction is greatest in the central section of coast in our study area (difference between index values with and without coastal habitats considered)

3) Where would habitat resotration lead to the greatest risk reduction

A3) The central section of the coast in our study area stands to gain the most reduction in coastal exposure if habitat restorations are put in place
